# zmk-config-trackball


This project drives my Thumbs Up! Trackball keyboard, its version supporting ProMicro and nice!nano:

Trying to create a ZMK version supporting PMW-3360 sensor.
The original version for that was using a lot of other projects before they were merged into the trunk of ZMK:
	https://github.com/trentrand/zmk-pmw3360-driver
I import settings from that original version into this one.
